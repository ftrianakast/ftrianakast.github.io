        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I'm Felipe Triana, a Colombian software engineer who found a home in Berlin. My journey in tech started in Bogotá,
          where I earned my Computer Science degree from Universidad de los Andes with a thesis on AI-powered skin disease detection
          using ontologies—pretty fitting given my current focus on AI/ML.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Over the past 12+ years, I've built distributed systems serving hundreds of millions of users at companies like eBay,
          Zalando, and Prodigious. What drives me is the intersection of scale, architecture, and innovation—especially now
          with AI transforming how we build software.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          Today, I'm a Staff Software Engineer at eBay, where I lead technical projects from design to delivery and extensively
          leverage AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) for 75%+ of my daily workflow. I'm passionate about functional
          programming, system scalability, and making AI work in production.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-macondo mb-4" style="color: var(--color-gold);">Beyond the Code</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Music is my second language. In 2022, I founded <strong>Cumbe</strong>, a Colombian traditional music ensemble in Berlin.
          We play gaita (Colombian flute), bandola (Colombian string instrument), and guitar, bridging my Colombian heritage with
          Berlin's diverse music scene. It's a reminder that creativity takes many forms—whether architecting microservices or
          arranging a cumbia.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          I'm also deeply involved in the functional programming community. I co-organized Bogotá Lambda meetup and frequently
          speak about FP concepts using Scala and Haskell. The principles of immutability, composition, and pure functions guide
          both my code and my thinking.
